        Not the same old workout! Not the same old results!
        Mt. Ogden Crossfit is not the typical gym; we offer so much more. You won’t find someone in front of a mirror doing “Curls for the Girls.” Nor will be bored doing the same old treadmill or elliptical routine. In fact, you won’t even find those machines, instead, we train you to be a machine. We prescribe total body, functional movements performed at high intensities. No matter if you are a weekend warrior, high-level athlete, or parents who want to keep up with the kids,CrossFit can improve your life and make an active lifestyle easier. But most importantly you will create results and have a blast doing it! You can’t say that about any old gym, can you?
        <br><br>
        Our coaches backgrounds range from stay-at-home-mom to ex-NFL player to MMA grappler. Expect a warm welcome and to make lifelong friends while you train together. Expect to meet and exceed all your goals.

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content >
              <p>The biggest thing that seperates CrossFit from your standard gym is community. Getting fit and healthy can be hard. Why not join a supportive community that will empower you to be the best you that you can be? A frequent statement from our members is that CrossFit takes less willpower to do. No need to plan your own workouts, or default to the treadmill because you have no clue what to do or the equipment you want is taken. Just.Show.Up.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content >
              <p>The "WOD" is the "workout of the day." Each day a new WOD is posted to CrossFit.com, and it's part of a complete program designed to improve strength and conditioning. The CrossFit.com program is characterized by three days of work before one day of rest, though athletes may alter this pattern. The WOD can be scaled (adjusted) to provide a suitable challenge for athletes at any level.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>That's what the coaches are there for. Before each WOD they will go over the movements and scaling options. And there is always time to ask the coach if you're unsure of how to modify a movement to your abilities.</p>

                You may think that CrossFit is just a bunch of super fit people throwoing around heavy weight like it's nothing. But, that's not an acurate picture of what you'll find when you join. Our box has members with all different abilities and different goals. There of course are the ones who have several years of fitness under there belt, but there are also members who just started and have no real history in sports/fitness. The only thing we all have in common is that we're here just trying to improve our health and fitness in a supportive comunity.
